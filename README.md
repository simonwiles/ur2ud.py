Converts Indic text romanized according to the ISO15919 conventions into Devanāgarī.  Inspired in part by John Smith's `ur2ud` (available [here](http://bombay.indology.info/software/programs/index.html)), and named in recognition of that fact.

Usable as a python package:

    from ur2ud import ur2ud
    devanagari = ur2ud(roman)
